Gameplay:

1-The game starts with player 1 rolling a six-sided dice. The number rolled is added to player 1's score.

2-Player 1 can continue rolling the dice as long as they want, and each number rolled is added to their score. However, if they roll a 1, their turn ends and any points accumulated during that turn are lost.

3-Once player 1's turn ends, it is player 2's turn to roll the dice and accumulate points in the same way.

4-The game continues in this way, with each player taking turns to roll the dice and accumulate points until one of the players reaches 100 points.

5-The game ends as soon as a player reaches 100 points. That player is declared the winner, and the game is over.

Rules:

1-Players must take turns rolling the dice and accumulating points, and cannot roll the dice out of turn.

2-If a player rolls a 1, their turn immediately ends, and any points accumulated during that turn are lost.

3-If a player reaches 100 points, the game immediately ends and that player is declared the winner.

4-If both players reach 100 points on the same turn, the game is tied and both players are declared winners.

5-Players can agree to play multiple rounds of the game to determine an overall winner.
